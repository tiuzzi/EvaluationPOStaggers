# EvaluationPOStaggers
Master thesis (MATT) Maitrise en Traduction et Technologies @ University of Geneva

Part-of-speech tagging is the most common form of corpus annotation. The creation and use of annotated corpora are widely spread across a variety of disciplines such as translation studies, computational linguistics, language learning, etc. This master thesis presents an evaluation of three part-of-speech taggers for French. All systems are freely available for non-commercial use but differ in the approach to POS tagging (a MaxEnt Markov model, a probabilistic model with decision trees and an artificial neural network model) as well as in the way they interface to the user. The aim is to provide users with an overview on different alternatives for the morphosyntactic annotation of French corpora and the opportunity to choose the system that best suits their needs, whether it is in terms of the quality of the annotation with respect to text typologies, type of files to be processed or skills required to implement it and deploy it.
