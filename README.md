# EvaluationPOStaggers
Master thesis (MATT) Maitrise en Traduction et Technologies @ University of Geneva

This master thesis presents a comparison of three part-of-speech taggers for French. All selected taggers are freely available for non-commercial use but differ in the algorithm dealing with the POS annotation task (a MaxEnt Markov Model, a probabilistic model with decision trees and an artificial neural network model) as well as in the way they interface to the user. This multi-layered evaluation is built upon two series of experiments where taggers are tested without training or tuning: in the first series, the procedures necessary for the deployment of each tagger are illustrated so as to ascertain that their implementation is simple enough for individuals with moderate knowledge in computer science. A feature inspection is also performed to give account of the modules embedded in each system (tokenisation, lemmatisation, etc.). In the second series of experiments, a quantitative evaluation of the taggersâ€™ performance on four different text types (speech transcripts, literature, product reviews and legal texts) is provided: a black-box usage is simulated to identify which system produces the most accurate annotation for each text typology. The purpose of this thesis is twofold: it aims to provide users with an overview on different alternatives for the morphosyntactic annotation of French corpora and the opportunity to choose the system that best suits their needs, whether it is in terms of the quality of the annotation with respect to text typology, the type of files to be handled or the skills required to implement it and deploy it.
